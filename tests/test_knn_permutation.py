"""--permutation_seed: same seed must give the same graph, run to run.

The whole point of the flag is to measure how much cell order changes a
clustering. That measurement is only meaningful if the permutation itself is
reproducible -- otherwise a rerun is a different experiment and nothing is
comparable. These pin that, plus the invariants that let downstream modules
ignore the permutation entirely: outputs stay keyed by barcode, and the set of
cells is unchanged.
